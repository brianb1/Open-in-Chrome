# Open in Chrome

Safari extension that opens the current page in Chrome. See [this post](http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome) by John Gruber for the "why" on this one.

Note: the extension depends on an AppleScript application to communicate with Chrome, so it will not work on Windows.

## Usage

1. [Download](https://github.com/lhagan/Open-in-Chrome/zipball/master) and extract the ZIP file
2. Install the extension (double-click OpenInChrome.safariextz)
3. Put the ChromeHelper app anywhere you want and double-click it to register with Mac OS X (nothing will happen yet)
4. Click the Open in Chrome arrow button in Safari to open the current page in Chrome
